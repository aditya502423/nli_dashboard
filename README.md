Project Title: Near Losss Investigation Dashboard

Problem Statement: 

In large engineering, oil & gas, or construction projects, sometimes mistakes or unsafe events happen that almost lead to a loss (like an injury, equipment damage, or delay). These are called Near Losses.
Even though no damage happens, they are serious warnings — and if ignored, they can lead to real losses in the future.
The problem was:
Near loss events were being recorded but not analyzed properly
No one knew which departments were causing most of these near losses
The company didn’t know how much schedule delay or money could be lost due to these
There was no proper tracking of the root causes (why these events happen)

Purpose of the Dashboard

Track all Near Loss Incidents (NLI)
Measure their impact on time (schedule) and money (financial)
Identify which teams or disciplines are responsible
Analyze the root causes (like poor procedure, lack of tools, etc.)
Help management take preventive actions before real damage happens

Tools Used:

Power BI Desktop DAX for custom measures Power Query for data transformation,SharePoint NIntex forms for gathering Data
